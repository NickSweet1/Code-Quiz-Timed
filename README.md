# Coding Quiz

This is a quiz with basic coding questions written with HTML, CSS, and JS. 


## Usage

It asks 10 questions and gives you 100 seconds to answer them all. After you answer each question, you will be probpted with the next one. The quiz is over when all ten questions are answered or the timer runs out. If a question is answered correctly, the user scores 100 points. If the user answers incorrectly, the user loses 50 points and 5 seconds are deducted from the timer. The user can then post thier score to the highscore chart.
